/* 
 This CSS file is located in the "public" directory, making it directly accessible 
 via a URL (e.g., http://yourdomain.com/index.css).
*/

/* Apply the Arial font to all elements with the "test" class */
.test {
    font-family: Arial;
}

/*
 Notes:
 - Unlike CSS files in "resources/css", this file is not processed by Vite.
 - It can be included in a Blade template using:

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('index.css') }}">

 - Use the "public" folder for styles that do not require preprocessing.
 - For optimized CSS management (e.g., TailwindCSS, SASS, or PostCSS), it is recommended 
   to place CSS files in "resources/css" and use Vite for compilation.
